### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

My name is Christian Dennig and I work as a Cloud Solution Architect at Microsoft in Germany.

My focus is Azure and the so called "Cloud Native" space. So all the cool stuff around app dev, container technologies, Kubernetes etc. And well, what nobody told me before: I'm aging faster than I would like to ðŸ˜‰

ðŸ“£ Motto: "I've done everything wrong first, so that you don't have to".
